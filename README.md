# z86 - A High-Performance 80286-Class Softcore CPU

z86 is a pipelined 16-bit x86 CPU softcore that implements real-mode 80286 instructions. It's designed to be a high-performance, compact implementation. It is a work-in-progress, currently capable of booting PC AT BIOS and running IBM BASIC in Verilator simulation.

## Architecture Overview

z86 uses a **5-stage pipeline** to achieve high performance:
- **FETCH**: Instruction fetch with a 32-byte buffer, mostly single-cycle.
- **DECODE1**: Initial instruction decoding and prefix handling.
- **DECODE2**: 2nd stage decoding with effective address calucation and hazard detection.
- **EXECUTE**: ALU operations, memory access, and microcode execution.
- **WRITE-BACK**: Register file updates and flag management.

The pipeline is designed to complete most instructions in a single cycle, with complex instructions handled by microcode for multi-cycle execution. The pipeline design is inspired by the 80486 processor.

## Key Features 

- **5-stage pipeline** implementation
- **8086 compatibility** with all base instructions
- **Real-mode 80286 instruction set** support, e.g. `PUSHA/POPA/INS/OUTS` etc.
- **Hardwired implementation of most instructions** for single-cycle execution.
- **Microcode-driven complex instructions** for multi-cycle operations
- **32-bit wide memory bus** to provide enough bandwidth for instructions and data
- **Comprehensive test suite** with 8088, 80186, and 80286 tests

## ðŸ”„ Work in Progress
- **Cache implementation** (framework exists)
- **Performance optimization** and tuning
- **Additional testing on FPGAs**
